We bootstrapped this thing from nothing, and I'm not about to blow our runway on rent.\n\nThat said, I know we need to look professional.

That's a pretty significant difference, especially when Option A also means we're basically starting over with new customers and certifications. I mean, break-even in 18-24 months versus 11-13 months? That's a lot of runway where we're burning through capital.\n\nBut then again, I keep thinking about those margins \u2013 9% now versus potentially 35-40% with sustainable textiles. That's hard to ignore. And honestly, three good people have already walked out the door this year. I'm not sure incremental improvements are going to excite anyone or secure our future long-term.\n\nWhat's your take on the financial risk here?

That matters when you're trying to sleep at night, you know? Plus keeping the existing facility and customers means we're not gambling everything on a completely new market.\n\nBut... *sighs* I don't know. My dad built something that lasted 35 years.
