I've spent my whole life being the responsible one, and I'm starting to wonder what I've missed. But at the same time, I can't help calculating risk and value.

I didn't build this business by chasing the latest shiny thing, you know?\n\nBut then I think about those Whole Foods contracts and my operations manager breathing down my neck, and I wonder if I'm being too cautious. The AI stuff in SupplyFlow360 sounds impressive, but I've also seen what happens when technology gets too complicated.

I can just picture myself missing out on important conversations or dinner plans if I'm staying somewhere separate.

I've been so isolated these past couple years, and the idea of actually experiencing Athens in a real neighborhood sounds kind of wonderful.

As a freelancer, I've learned the hard way that budget certainty is huge for me. Like, I can't tell you how many times I've committed to something thinking \"oh, I'll have the money\" and then had a slow month that just wrecked me.\n\nBut at the same time... *sighs* ...I keep thinking about being locked into specific hotels and dates for three whole weeks. What if I get to Bangkok and absolutely love it and want to stay longer? Or what if Hanoi just doesn't vibe with me? The idea of being stuck in a place because I pre-paid for a hotel room makes me feel kind of trapped, you know?\n\nI guess I'm worried about two opposite things: spending too much if I go flexible, or feeling like I'm on rails if I go with the package.

But at the same time, my income is all over the place as a freelancer, and the idea of dropping over $5K upfront makes me really nervous. What if I have a slow few months after the trip and need that buffer?\n\nI also keep thinking about how I've never done a trip like this solo before.

The shared villa at $400 is much more manageable for folks like me and probably the freelance photographer too.\n\nBut I'll admit, I'm torn.
