There's this tension between staying true to what Cascade is and being left behind.\n\n*pauses, choosing words carefully*\n\nI guess I need to feel confident that whatever we choose, we can actually execute it well without everything falling apart.

A decision that puts all of that at risk because we overreached... that terrifies me more than growing slowly.\n\nWhat's your take on this?
