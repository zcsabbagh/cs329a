I've never been good at spending money on myself\u2014it always feels irresponsible somehow.\n\n*pauses, looking down*\n\nI guess what I'm trying to figure out is whether I should lean into what I know I'm good at\u2014the cultural stuff, the learning, the structure\u2014or if this is my chance to actually do something different for once.

Or at least, the me I've been.\n\nBut I keep thinking about what my therapist said about reconnecting with spontaneity, and I'll admit, the Algarve option kind of terrifies me in a way that feels... maybe necessary? I've spent the last year living in depositions and patent briefs. The idea of cliff jumping is absurd for someone like me, but there's a part of me\u2014probably the part my ex-wife was talking about\u2014that wonders if I need something that shakes me up a bit.\n\n*pauses, looking conflicted*\n\nThen again, $2,200 versus $2,850... the attorney in me can't help but notice I'd save $650 with Option B.

At the same time, I'm trying to be mindful of my budget - the grant covers most of it, but I don't love the idea of spending a lot of extra personal money if I don't have to.\n\nThe other thing is that the conference schedule is pretty brutal - early starts and late networking events.

This is my first big conference in a while, and I'm already anxious about the networking side of things. But at the same time, $1,560 is more than my grant covers, and I'd have to dip into personal savings. \n\nThe Plaka apartment is so much more affordable and honestly sounds lovely\u2014I love the idea of actually experiencing Athens, not just the conference bubble.

And God knows after the year I've had, the idea of just... not having to think about logistics sounds really appealing.\n\nBut then I look at that Plaka apartment and something in me lights up a little. It's less than half the price, which would leave me room in the budget for other things. And honestly? The idea of having my own space with a kitchen and that balcony view... after months of caretaking and then living in a half-empty house, having a real home base - even temporarily - sounds kind of healing. Plus, I got into marine biology because I love exploring and discovering things.

But $245K is a lot of money, and that 35% failure rate? That keeps me up at night. Angela and I have worked too hard to build stability for our family, and with Sarah's tuition coming up, the idea of burning through most of our cash on something that might not work for 16-20 months makes me genuinely nervous.\n\nThe infrastructure upgrades feel... safer isn't quite the right word, but more solid?

She's been with me since day one, and if she walks, I'm not just losing a chef - I'm losing the heart of what makes Harvest & Hearth work. So whatever we do has to actually fix the kitchen bottlenecks without turning into some nightmare project that makes things worse before they get better.\n\nAnd look, I'll be straight with you - my wife and I didn't come from money. That $95,000 represents years of reinvesting every spare dollar back into this place.

I like that we can spread it out over weekends, and god knows I understand gas ranges better than I'd ever understand \"IoT sensors\" or whatever. Plus keeping fifty-four grand in the bank would let me sleep at night, especially with the landlord circling like a vulture. \n\nBut I don't know - is the traditional route really going to solve the problem?
