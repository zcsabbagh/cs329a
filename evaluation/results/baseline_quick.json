That weighs on me every single day. I don't want to be the guy who comes in after Dad retires and starts laying people off, you know?\n\nBut honestly, I'm also just trying to figure out which path is... simpler? Less complicated to execute? I've got enough on my plate learning to run this place without my father looking over my shoulder.

We've got folks who've been with us since my dad started this thing. That matters to me.

That's over a year of disruption, training headaches, dealing with equipment issues... \n\nThe design studio thing seems a lot more straightforward, you know? Five months and we're up and running. Plus, I'm not exactly thrilled about the conversation I'd have to have with twelve people who've been loyal to this company \u2013 some of them worked with my father.

My daughter's college is coming up, and I promised my wife we'd take that trip to India next year to visit family. The last thing I want is to be stuck managing some massive overhaul while trying to keep everything else running smoothly.\n\nIs one of these options clearly the simpler path forward?

Fourteen months of implementation, dealing with German engineers, retraining everyone, managing the transition... *sighs* And then I've got to figure out what happens with those twelve positions. Some of these folks have been here since my dad was running things.\n\nThe design studio feels more... I don't know, manageable? Five months and we're up and running.
