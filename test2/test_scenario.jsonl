They've been dating for 18 months and this is their first major scheduling conflict that feels like a relationship test. Marcus's extended family only gathers every three years for their reunion in Minnesota, and his grandmother specifically requested he bring Elena to meet everyone. Meanwhile, Elena's college roommate and best friend Sofia is getting married in San Diego the same weekend, and Elena is supposed to give a maid of honor speech. Both events are non-negotiable timing-wise, they can only afford one cross-country trip, and Elena has been feeling like Marcus doesn't prioritize her friendships. Marcus worries that missing the reunion will disappoint his traditional family who are already skeptical about their relationship lasting. The decision needs to be made this week as both events require travel arrangements.", "option_a": {"name": "Attend Marcus's Family Reunion", "description": "Travel to Minneapolis for the Chen family's three-day reunion at a lake resort, where Elena would meet Marcus's 23 extended family members including his 78-year-old grandmother who has early-stage dementia.
